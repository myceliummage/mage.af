		<p>"Well you see officer, I had to become Cigar Jesus because my mom bought me this purple button down from TJ Maxx for my first grown up engineering gig at a steel plant and I wore the piss out of it on the big time midwestern college student corporate intern circuit before something finally snapped and I decided I had to see for myself what the American Dream was all about anyways."</p>

<p>Neither of them were amused. Half a cigarette still burning a lazy red eye in the night air hung loosely from Officer Dalton's mustached lip.</p>

<p>"Just step out of the car son" said the lip.</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Do you have any weapons on you?"</p>

<p>I paused for a moment to deciding how a well a "bam bam just these guns baby" bicep joke would go over.</p>

<p>"Do you HAVE any WEAPONS on you?" the lip repeated, with some force.</p>

<p>"No sir," I answered, figuring the moment had passed.</p>

<p>"Jesus kid just answer the questions - tryin to get home tonight you think I wanna be dealing with your sorry ass?" the red-eye'd lip breathed.</p>

<p>The eye was starting to look a little less lazy and a little more lonely now. The kind of lonely where you actually start to enjoy these tweaker kids coming down from Salt Lake to wreck their minds against God in the desert because at least it gives you something more to do on the Garfield County night shift than hear the same stories about your partner's never ending divorce for the fiftieth time.</p>

<p>"Yes... sir - " I replied - struggling to arrest the pat-down and remove his hand from my crotch only to have my arm slammed against the hood of my fifteen year old two hundred seventy something thousand mile Pontiac Vibe.</p>

<p>" - but as I was saying I had to become Cigar Jesus because I spent the better part of my golden years proselytizing instead of getting laid and I'm sure you know that can only last so long till something snaps and you tell your best buddy to drive you to the side of Wisconsin State Highway 18 South with nothing but a 40L pack on your back, your heart in your right thumb, and enough gumption in your soul to throw yourself at the open road of the wild west over and over and over and over until you find out what this American Dream your grandad chased from Ireland to Minnesota via Ellis Island to become a world-renown Mayo Clinic bone surgeon on the dime of the UUUUnited States Navy and sire twenty some grandkids along the way was all about anyways."</p>

<p>I felt my head slam against the hood of my 2006-wagon-with-far-too-many-miles-on-it and my field of vision become a lone red eye against a field of stars.</p>

<p>"God somebody really outta teach these pigs down in Escalante some manners" I breathed, wishing I could rub the now-sure-to-be-growing bump on my crown.</p>

<p>"Fucking JESUS shut the FUCK UP" screamed the lip, spittle painting my face and nearly extinguishing the eye.</p>

<p>I threw my head back and laughed. "You liked the part where I said the U really long in United States Navy didn't you."</p>

<p>"GOD DAMMNIT KID WHERE ARE THE DRUGS" screamed the lip as it spewed ash up my nose.</p>

<p>"Don't got no more officer" I said smiling back. "Already met with God. Faced the desert and stole away its strength. It's in here now." I pointed to my chest, grinning like Prometheus after besting Olympus.</p>

<p>This threw the lip for a moment so I seized my chance to continue " - really though, the question you oughta be asking is 'Why did this punk-ass-tweaker-kid outta salt lake who's larping blue collar carpenter have to become Cigar Jesus and ruin my night of cramming gas station churros past the eye in my lip and pretending to care about my partner's divorce and was it really about the stupid purple shirt his mom bought him for his dress up games with the midwestern hick town corpo golf outing types or was it more about the eternal trepidation in the heart of man that holds him back from answering the call of uncertainty and the chance 8,000 miles of roadway laid on top of this ancient continental soil could lead him straight to the heart of the American Dream that started it all, anyways?'"</p>
