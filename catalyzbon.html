                <br> it i wanna sparkle and see how much we can sparkle together cuz we're pretty cool i think actually and pretty creative and pretty on the 
                <br> cusp of getting good at playing with our energy in the world you know and i have ideas and visions sometimes but im not sure what they
                <br> mean or if theyir legit or if theyre were im actually capable of getting there but i wanna try cuz that seems to be the important bit that
                <br> 's what god told me he said 'mage you gotta try' and so i mean who am i to argue with a burning bush you kno w............. so i figured
                <br> i guess why not lets maybe just get together and hang out and vibe and try and just see what sticks you know?
